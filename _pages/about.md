I earned my first undergrad degree at Fundação João Pinheiro School of Government in public policy and government management. By the end I thought we would be an interesting choice to go for another undergrad, so I started computational mathematics at UFMG. I'm interested in the intersection of public policy, math and computer science.

I have experience in programming (R, C, C++ and Python) and have been working with school violence in the State Secretary of Education of Minas Gerais, Brazil.
