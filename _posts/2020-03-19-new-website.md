I started my journey in Data Science - didn't know what it was and don't know exactly what is today - back in the start of 2018. By recommendation of my friend and colleague [Arthur Cheib](https://twitter.com/arthurcheib) I subscribe to [DataCamp Platform](https://www.datacamp.com/).

In our work in the State Secretary of Education (SEE) of Minas Gerais in Brazil (**views on my own**) we found ourselves working with data in the field of education. The main concern at that time was to have tempestive information about the schools and the administrative processes that organizes them.

But, in that time we only have had access to tools like Excel or - barely - SPSS. These tools are great in their way, yet the SEE is organized in 47 regions and has approximately 3,6 thousand schools in 853 municipalities. So, these tools weren't able to attend our demand that was to create reports for decision making.

In DataCamp, we mainly focused on learning the R language, because we thought it would be an easier transition to programming as we were undegrads in public policy. So, learning the [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) proved to be an excellent tool for our purposes. There a lot of free resources too.

Getting into the Data Science field we found an extremely active R community on Twitter (use *#rstats*) where we could find some of the former DataCamp's instructors and a lot of people that were helping eachother to get into this field. So, by reading David Robinson's post ["Advice to aspiring data scientists: start a blog"](http://varianceexplained.org/r/start-blog/), I started this journey to create my personal website.

With my lack of knowledge in the web programming languages - HTML, JavaScript and CSS - and in the internet in general (for programming purposes), I started to look after tutorials on how to start personal website that could handle posts about Data Science. I found ["How to Setup GitHub Pages (2018) | Data Science Portfolio"] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWrcgHwSG8M&t=923s) the easier one to get started. So, many thanks to DataOptimal for that.

This website is intended to be a homepage for myself linking to another social medias - like GitHub, Twitter and E-mail - and a place where I can share some experience in Data Science, by tasks or projects. I would be grateful if it could help you in someway, like a lot of blogs have helped me. Feel free to send me feedback.
